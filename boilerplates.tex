\subsubsection{Quality}

The numbers used in this section reflects the goal numbers in section \ref{goal_1_requirements}

\paragraph{Completeness}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The requirements does not cover what will happen if a faulty value is submitted as the selectable minimum time gap.
    \item The requirements does not explicitly deal with the situation where no selectable time gap value is submitted. It is possible to assume that goal 2 takes care of the situation, but it is not explicitly stated.
    \item The requirements does not limit the selectable time gap value.
    \item The requirements does not take into account what happens when the ACC system goes inactive/offline.
    \item The requirements does not take into account the time gap value going above the limit. 
    \item The requirements does not take into account the situation where both following mode and set speed mode have equal measured speed.
    \item The requirements does not explain where the speed in the set speed mode originates.
    \item The requirement does not cover what will happen in a situation where the wrong vehicle or another object is selected.
    \item The requirements does not explain where the range in the set range mode originates.
    \item The requirement does not deal with how erroneous/wrong sensory input is handled.
    \item The requirement does not deal with corner cases where several vehicles is detected within range B.
    \item The requirement does not detail what happens with manual speed input or if the ACC is disengaged during inhibiting of acceleration or clearance.
    \item The requirement does not detail what happens when the ACC goes offline or if sensory input is incorrect during curves.
    
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Correctness}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It has not been defined who sets the speed value or how it is obtained in goal 5.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Ambiguity}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The word selectable in goal 1 has different meanings to people. Selectable through voice, menu, etc?
    \item The term vehicle can be interpreted differently and should be defined.
    \item The word appropriate is goal 4 is open to interpretation.
    \item The word active used throughout the requirements can be unclear. Is the system active if it has and is in a standby mode?
    \item The word present must be more clearly defined, is any part of the object within a certain area enough, or does large parts of it need to be present? 
    \item Requirement 12  needs to be more clearly defined. Does it override manual input as well, or just automatic?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Goal 2}
When $<$optional preconditions/trigger$>$ the $<$system name$>$ shall $<$system response$>$

\subsubsection{Requirements}
\label{goal_2_requirements}

\paragraph{ACC active-state}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When the ACC is active, the vehicle speed shall be controlled automatically either to maintain a time gap to a forward vehicle, or to maintain the set speed
    \item When brake force higher than initiated is applied the ACC shall be deactivated
    \item When the ACC is active the driver shall be informed with the set speed information
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{ACC off-state}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When the ACC system shuts down the driver shall be informed
    \item When the ACC system is not available the driver shall be informed
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{ACC stand-by}

    \item When the ACC is active the driver shall be able to deactivate the system with a touch on the clutch pedal
    \item When the ACC is in stand-by the system shall preform a self-test and shut down if not completed
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Testability}
The numers reflect the goals in section \ref{goal_2_requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This can be tested either by a user driving or a simulated test. The goal is to test if the the vehicle speed is controlled either automatically by maintaining a time gap to a forward veichle, or to maintain the set speed. So this is a to-part test where you cant test both requirements at once. Does require to test two systems, time gap and maintaining the set speed. The vehicle shall maintain a set time gap to the forward vehicle. On the other test the vehicle shall accelerate or decelerate if the vehicle speed is either lower or higher than the set speed. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item The system shall deactivate the ACC if active whenever the brake force applied by the user is higher than initiated. This test can be performed by a driver and to see if the ACC is deactivated when the brakes is used. One can also simulate this test saying that a given brake force is applied. What this brake force is set to have to be calibrated before the test. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item By activating the ACC, a symbol or some other indication shall be displayed to the user. This can be tested simply by either running a test or an experiment. The requirement is clear and concise. Does not require other systems to be tested and should be done fairly simple. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item When the ACC system shuts down the user shall be notified. This can be done by causing a self test to fail and shut down the system through an experiment. The requirement is clear and concise. Does require that other systems is tested and functional with a simulated error in the self test. One can observe if the ACC is deactivated and that a notification is forwarded to the driver. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item By disabling the ACC a notification shall be displayed to the user. This requirement is somewhat wage and a definition of what informed means shall be specified. This test can be done by having the ACC deactivated an that an icon in the driver console to be activated if the ACC is unable. The test does not require other system to be tested and should be a fairly straight forward test to complete. Possible to retest and restart test.
    \item You can either execute a test or run an experiment. The requirement is clear and concise. Does require that the clutch system is working correctly. The force of the clutch pedal can either be simulated or with a physical test.One can observe whether the system is deactivated or not. It is possible to retest and restart test.
    \item By simulating a self test of the system one can observe if the system shuts down if the self test fails. This can either be done with a test or as an experiment. The requirement does not specify what type of error on the self test to be failing. Does require the self test of the vehicle to be tested and working, and this can be mimicked through a computer. One can observe if ACC is deactivated with an incomplete test. Possible to retest and restart test.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Quality}
\paragraph{Completeness}

    \item The requirement does not say anything about how to handle this control.
    \item The requirement doesn't say how much brake force is required to deactivate the ACC.
    \item The requirement doesn't specify how the user shall be informed.
    \item The requirement does not say what a failed self test is and how to display this to a user.
    \item The requirement does not concern what makes the ACC unavailable, it only says that if it is the driver shall be informed.
    \item The requirement does not say anything about how much the clutch pedal shall be pressed.
    \item The requirement doesn't say anything about when this test shall be performed or if the user shall be notified.
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Correctness}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There is no other way to deactivate the ACC than to push the brake on a automatic gearbox and therefore goal 6 can only occur on a car with a manual stick.
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Ambiguity}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The term informed is not specified and is a bit vague.
    \item The word touch can be a bit confused to some users and should be specified.
